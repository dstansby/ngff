Requests for comments (RFCs) are used to discuss and capture
high-level decisions within the NGFF community. Throughout
the `specifications themselves <../specifications/>`_,
RFCs can be referenced to provide readers further background reading.
For example, `RFC-1 <1/>`_ defines the process in detail, but an overview
is available under `Process <process/>`_. Authors interested in
creating an RFC should take a look through
the `listing <listing.html>`_ of current RFCs as well as the
`template <1/template.html>`_ which should be copied and modified.
