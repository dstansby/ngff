Requests for comments (RFCs) are used to discuss and capture
high-level decisions within the NGFF community. Throughout
the `specifications themselves <../specifications/>`_,
RFCs can be referenced to provide readers further background reading.

The RFC process is defined in `RFC-1 <1/index.html>`_
and anyone interested in participating in the RFC
process should familiarize themselves with that text.

Relevant sections describing the phases depicted in
the diagram below include:

 * `DRAFT <1/index.html#draft>`_
 * `RFC <1/index.html#rfc>`_
 * `SPEC <1/index.html#spec>`_

A `template <1/template.html>`_ is available for the
creation of new RFCs.

Authors interested in creating an RFC may also want to take a look through
the listing of current RFCs below.

If there are any questions, please contact the editors under
